## New To SCSS/SASS
This was a really great chance to use such a well known and loved compiler. I truly enjoyed this. Were it not for the 6 hour limmit, I would have really like to finish.

## Problems that arose
Well, I didn't know SASS so I tried to learn that during the time. It's not honestly that trying to get the hang of, but still was a factor. I just didn't have enough time to finish the bulk of the paragraphs though they are fairly simple text alignment issues. I chose to focus on the more complicated head section. My other hurdle was using a .not() selector in JQuery in order to exclude the three boxes meant to navigate.
